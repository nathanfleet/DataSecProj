## Instructions

You can run `python populate_medical_table.py` to generate 100 random fields in the medical table  
This should be done after creating the database and signing up as an 'H' user

Added .env.defaults file to store necessary keys for encryption and integrity checks for both groups  
Copy contents from .env.defaults to a new .env file and fill out the keys (two random 32 byte hex strings)
